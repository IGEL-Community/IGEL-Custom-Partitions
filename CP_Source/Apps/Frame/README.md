### Frame App 6

For all release notes pertaining to Frame App 6, please see Dizzion's [official release notes](https://docs.dizzion.com/releases/tags/frame-app).

-----

## Frame IGEL Custom Profiles

To get started, read each of the following profiles to see which sounds like the right fit for you and then import it into the IGEL UMS following the instructions below.

### Important notice

IGEL UMS-11 profiles has ***-ums11.xml** in their name.  
IGEL UMS-12 profiles has ***-ums12.ipm** in their name

IGEL UMS-11 profiles by default will provide support for Frame App v7 only! If support for frame app v6 is required, before importing profiles user will need to modify following line in XML file:

```
<ivalue classname="sessions.custom_application%.cmdline" variableExpression="" variableSubstitutionActive="false">/custom/frame/frame-saml2-kiosk-launcher.sh v7</ivalue>
```
by replacing "v7" with "v6", so that script will know which version of app to start and other configurations.


### Basic Frame App Profile
**IGEL UMS-11 command:**
```js
import 'igel/frame-app-basic-profile-ums11.xml'
```

This Custom Profiles simply enables a Frame App icon on the IGEL Desktop. To launch Frame App with certain command line arguments, edit IGEL profile and append your command line argument(s) to the end of the command line.

Command line arguments for Frame app are defined here: [Linux command-line arguments](https://docs.dizzion.com/platform/session/frame-app/config#command-line-arguments).

### Frame SAML2 Kiosk Mode Profile

**IGEL UMS-11 command:**
```js
import 'igel/frame-saml2-kiosk-profile-ums11.xml'
```

This profile is designed to support a specific end user workflow and assumes a particular Frame configuration.

#### SAML2 Kiosk Mode User Experience

1. Frame App's cache is wiped to ensure a fresh session and authentication.
2. Frame App is launched in Kiosk Mode with multiple monitor support, presenting a third-party identity provider's login screen.
3. After logging in, end users will be taken by Frame App directly to the desktop or application (depends on the Launch Link configuration).
4. When a Frame session starts, the remote desktop will be in full-screen mode.
5. When end users disconnects by action or inactivity timeout, they'll see an option to resume their session for the duration of the account/Launchpad's configured idle timeout.
6. When a user quits the session or shuts down windows, they'll be logged out and redirected to the identity provider's initial login page.
7. If Frame App is closed, user can start a new session by launching Frame App with the Frame icon on the IGEL Desktop.

#### SAML2 + Kiosk mode requirements:

1. A *Published* Launchpad.
2. Configured identity provider with associated roles/permissions allowing access to the desired Frame Account.
3. Frame Launch Link with additional ["Quit and log out"](https://docs.fra.me/platform/session/advanced-integrations/#supported-query-params) url parameter: `&qlo=1`.
4. *Optional:* The Frame account production workload VMs can be joined to a Windows domain, if desired.

5. **Edit your IGEL UMS Custom Profile and go to**:
   > System > Firmware Customization > Environment Variables > Predefined

6. Paste your Launch Link:

     - `FRAME_LAUNCH_URL` - obtained from an Account's *Dashboard > Launchpad > Advanced Integrations* to get a configurable dialog with Launch Links. While we recommend Launch Links for Kiosk scenarios, the value of FRAME_LAUNCH_URL could instead be a standard Launchpad URL.

---

### Frame SAT Kiosk Mode Profile
**IGEL UMS-11 command:**
```js
import 'igel/frame-sat-kiosk-profile-ums11.xml'
```

The Frame SAT Kiosk Custom Profile is designed to support a specific end user workflow relying on Frame's SATs or [Secure Anonymous Tokens](https://docs.fra.me/platform/identity-and-access/secure-anonymous-tokens/) for identity; this flow also assumes a particular Frame configuration to support the kiosk experience as defined below.

#### SAT Kiosk Mode User Experience:

1. End users will not authenticate to a SAML2-based identity provider (this script uses the Frame Secure Anonymous Token (SAT) functionality for session authentication).
2. User cache is removed prior to start of Frame App to ensure no user preference settings have persisted since the prior use of Frame App.
3. Frame App will launch in "kiosk mode" (full screen).
4. End users will be taken by Frame App directly to the desktop or application (depends on the [Launch Link](https://docs.fra.me/platform/session/advanced-integrations/#launch-links) configuration).
5. When a Frame session starts, the remote desktop will be in full-screen mode.
6. When end users disconnect or close their session, Frame App will be restarted with a new SAT token. Disconnect behavior configurable with Frame Session Settings.

#### SAT + Kiosk configuration requirements:

1. A *Published* Launchpad.
2. API Provider configured at the Organization entity.
3. Secure Anonymous Token Provider at the Account entity granting a role of Launchpad User for a specific Launchpad in a Frame account (under the Organization entity).
4. Frame [Launch Link](https://docs.fra.me/platform/session/advanced-integrations/#launch-links) is used, rather than a Launchpad URL to support automatic start of the user's session and to simplify the UX.
5. *Optional:* The Frame account production workload VMs can be joined to a Windows domain, if desired.


#### Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured in the IGEL Custom Profile for this profile to work.

1. **Edit your IGEL UMS Custom Profile and go to**:
   > System > Firmware Customization > Environment Variables > Predefined

2. **Set the following environment variables:**
   - `FRAME_CLIENT_ID` - obtained from the API provider when a set of API credentials are created.
   - `FRAME_CLIENT_SECRET` - obtained from the API provider when a set of API credentials are created.
   -
      `FRAME_SAT_URL` - URL obtainable from the Playground.

      For example: `https://api.console.nutanix.com/v1/accounts/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-31d09e2881cd/secure-anonymous/secure-anon-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-c5e2dc93df1e/tokens`.
   - `FRAME_ACCOUNT_ID` - Sign in to [Frame Console](https://console.nutanix.com) as an Admin. Locate your account, click the three-dot menu, and select "update" to view the Account's entity settings. Next, copy the Account UUID from the browser's URL bar. For example: `https://console.nutanix.com/frame/account/YOUR-FRAME-ACCOUNT-UUID-HERE/basic-info`
   - `FRAME_EMAIL_DOMAIN` - email domain name used to create the anonymous user email addresses that will be visible in the Session Trail.
   - `FRAME_LAUNCH_URL` - obtained from an Account's *Dashboard > Launchpad > Advanced Integrations* to get a configurable dialog with Launch Links. While we recommend Launch Links for Kiosk scenarios, the value of FRAME_LAUNCH_URL could instead be a standard Launchpad URL.
   - `FRAME_TERMINAL_CONFIG_ID` - obtainable from the Launch Link URL or from your [Launchpad Settings -> Session API Integration](https://docs.fra.me/dev-hub/session-api/#required-session-api-components) dialog.
   - `FRAME_LOGOUT_URL` - Optional. Allows configuration of the "logout" behavior by specifying a URL. Useful when using a Frame Launch Link with additional ["Quit and log out"](https://docs.fra.me/platform/session/advanced-integrations/#supported-query-params) url parameter: `&qlo=1`.
   - `SESSION_RETRY_DURATION_MINUTES` - Optional. Default value of 10 (minutes). Specifies the duration this script will wait for a Session to connect to the workload VM. After this threshold is reached, the script will quit start over and try again.
